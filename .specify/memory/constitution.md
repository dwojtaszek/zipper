# Zipper Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. CLI-First Interface
All functionality MUST be exposed and controlled through the command-line interface. The CLI is the primary and only user interface for the application.

### II. Efficient, Stream-Based Processing
The application MUST process data in streams, writing directly to the output archive without storing intermediate files on disk. This is a non-negotiable performance requirement to handle large-scale data generation.

### III. Rigorous, Integration-Focused Testing
All new features or bug fixes MUST be accompanied by end-to-end tests that verify the correctness and integrity of the final output. While unit tests are not a primary focus at this time, the existing test suite MUST pass before any code is committed.

### IV. Documentation as the Source of Truth
The `Requirements.md` and `README.md` documents are the single source of truth for project requirements and features. All development work MUST be traceable to a requirement, and the agent is responsible for keeping these documents in sync with implementation changes. Tasks to read, update, and review these documents are an integral part of the development workflow.

### V. Automated and Consistent Development Workflow
The project relies on CI/CD automation for builds, tests, and releases. All commits MUST follow the Conventional Commits specification. Versioning MUST adhere to Semantic Versioning, with the `MAJOR.MINOR` version managed in the `.version` file and the `BUILD` number generated by the CI/CD pipeline.

### VI. Cross-Platform Compatibility
The application MUST be fully functional on Windows, Linux, and macOS. All new features and tests MUST be designed and implemented to run correctly on these platforms.

## Governance

All development practices and code contributions must adhere to the principles outlined in this constitution. Amendments to this constitution require a pull request, review, and approval from the project maintainers.
