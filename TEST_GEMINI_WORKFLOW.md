# Test for Gemini Workflow

This is a test file to verify that the Gemini AI review workflow is working properly after our fixes.

## Changes Made
- Added GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable to gemini-review.yml
- Made Gemini workflow jobs non-blocking with continue-on-error: true
- Fixed authentication issues for Gemini CLI

## Expected Result
The Gemini AI review should:
1. Successfully authenticate using the GEMINI_API_KEY
2. Complete without blocking the PR merge
3. Provide helpful review comments or complete gracefully

This file can be removed after testing is complete.
