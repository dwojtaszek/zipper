## Gemini Added Memories
- Always use `npx promptfoo` for `promptfoo` commands in this repository.
- When asked to commit, draft the commit message and commit directly without asking for confirmation.
- Source data files for promptfoo evaluations must have a .txt extension.
- To run the Zipper project, use the command: `dotnet run --project Zipper/Zipper.csproj -- [arguments]`.
- Use conventional commit messages (e.g., `feat(scope):`, `fix(scope):`, `docs(scope):`).
