# Feature Specification: Improve Build and Test Workflow

**Feature Branch**: `002-task-5-improve`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-05
- Q: Which branches should trigger the new unified workflow, and should it run on pull requests? ‚Üí A: Master branch only (current behavior)
- Q: How should the workflow handle build failures for specific platforms? Should it fail completely or continue with successful platforms? ‚Üí A: Fail entire workflow if any platform build fails
- Q: How long should build artifacts be retained in GitHub Actions storage? ‚Üí A: 7 days (default retention)
- Q: Should the workflow use build caching, and if so, what should be the cache strategy? ‚Üí A: Cache everything (dependencies, builds, tools)
- Q: What should trigger the release creation - should it happen automatically on successful builds or require manual approval? ‚Üí A: Automatic release on every successful build
**Input**: User description: "# Task 5: Improve Build and Test Workflow

## Description

To improve the efficiency and reliability of the CI/CD process, this task is to refactor the existing `build.yml` and `test.yml` workflows into a single, streamlined workflow. The new workflow will incorporate linting, parallel builds, and testing of the built artifacts.

## Implementation Steps

1.  **Combine Workflows:**
    *   Create a new workflow file named `build-and-test.yml` in the `.github/workflows` directory.
    *   Copy the existing build and test steps from `build.yml` and `test.yml` into the new file.
    *   Delete the old `build.yml` and `test.yml` files.

2.  **Add Linting Job:**
    *   Add a new job named `lint` to the beginning of the workflow.
    *   This job should use the `.editorconfig` file to check for code style violations.
    *   The build should fail if any linting errors are found.

3.  **Parallelize Builds:**
    *   Modify the `build` job to use a matrix strategy to run builds for Windows, Linux, and macOS in parallel.
    *   Each build in the matrix should produce a platform-specific artifact.

4.  **Add Test Job:**
    *   Add a new job named `test` that depends on the successful completion of the `build` job.
    *   The `test` job should download the build artifacts from the `build` job.
    -   The `test` job should also use a matrix strategy to run tests on all three platforms.
    *   The `test` job should run the tests against the downloaded artifacts.

5.  **Conditional Release:**
    *   Ensure the `release` job only runs if the `lint`, `build`, and `test` jobs are successful.
    *   The `release` job should download the artifacts from the `build` job.

## Acceptance Criteria

*   A single `build-and-test.yml` workflow file must be present in the `.github/workflows` directory.
*   The workflow must include a `lint` job that runs before the `build` job.
*   The `build` job must run in parallel for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
*   The `test` job must run after the `build` job and use the artifacts from the `build` job.
*   The `release` job must only run on successful completion of all previous jobs."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a development team member, I want a unified CI/CD workflow that automatically validates code quality, builds the application across multiple platforms, runs comprehensive tests, and creates releases only when all previous steps succeed, so that I can ensure consistent and reliable deployments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** code is pushed to the master branch, **When** the workflow starts, **Then** linting checks run first and fail the build if style violations are found
2. **Given** linting passes, **When** the build job runs, **Then** it builds the application in parallel for Windows, Linux, and macOS and produces platform-specific artifacts
3. **Given** all builds succeed, **When** the test job runs, **Then** it downloads the build artifacts and runs tests on all three platforms
4. **Given** lint, build, and test jobs all succeed, **When** the release job runs, **Then** it downloads the build artifacts and creates a release

### Edge Cases
- What happens when linting fails? The workflow should stop immediately without running build or test jobs
- How does system handle build failures for specific platforms? The workflow should fail completely and not proceed to testing, even if other platforms succeed
- What happens when tests fail on one platform? The entire workflow should fail and no release should be created
- What happens when .editorconfig file is missing? The lint job should be skipped with a warning, and workflow should continue to build phase
- What happens when artifact upload fails? The workflow should fail and not proceed to dependent jobs that require those artifacts
- What happens when cache restoration fails? The workflow should continue with a fresh build (cache miss is expected for new changes)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST validate code style using .editorconfig before any other CI/CD steps
- **FR-002**: System MUST build the application concurrently for Windows, Linux, and macOS environments
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate platform-specific build artifacts that can be downloaded by subsequent jobs
- **FR-004**: System MUST run automated tests against the built artifacts on all supported platforms
- **FR-005**: System MUST automatically create releases when all previous jobs (lint, build, test) complete successfully
- **FR-006**: System MUST fail fast and stop workflow execution if any job fails
- **FR-007**: System MUST manage job dependencies so they execute in the correct order (lint ‚Üí build ‚Üí test ‚Üí release)
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide build artifacts to the release job when all validation steps pass
- **FR-009**: System MUST retain build artifacts for 7 days to support debugging and re-use
- **FR-010**: System MUST cache dependencies, build outputs, and tools to optimize build performance

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Build Artifacts**: Platform-specific compiled application packages created during the build job
- **Workflow Jobs**: Sequential and parallel execution units (lint, build, test, release) with defined dependencies
- **Configuration Files**: .editorconfig and workflow definition files that control the CI/CD process
