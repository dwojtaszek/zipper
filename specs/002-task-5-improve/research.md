# Phase 0: Research Findings

**Feature**: Improve Build and Test Workflow
**Date**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Complete

## Key Research Areas & Decisions

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow Structure
**Decision**: Use unified workflow with matrix strategy for parallel builds and tests
**Rationale**: Existing build.yml already uses platform-specific builds with caching, test.yml uses matrix for testing. Combining them into a single workflow reduces complexity and improves artifact management.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate workflows (current state) - rejected due to complexity
- Multiple workflow files for different jobs - rejected due to coordination complexity

### 2. Build Caching Strategy
**Decision**: Comprehensive caching (dependencies, build outputs, tools)
**Rationale**: Based on user clarification to "cache everything". Current build.yml already implements platform-specific caching for build outputs. Extending to include dependencies and tools will optimize build times.
**Alternatives considered**:
- No caching - rejected due to performance impact
- Dependencies only - rejected as insufficient optimization

### 3. Artifact Management
**Decision**: 7-day retention with automatic artifact passing between jobs
**Rationale**: User clarified 7-day retention (default). GitHub Actions artifact storage provides reliable artifact passing between build, test, and release jobs.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Longer retention - rejected as unnecessary cost
- Shorter retention - rejected as insufficient for debugging

### 4. Test Execution Strategy
**Decision**: Test against downloaded build artifacts on all platforms
**Rationale**: Ensures tests validate actual build outputs, not source builds. Supports the principle of testing what gets released.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Test from source - rejected as not validating actual builds
- Test on single platform - rejected as insufficient cross-platform validation

### 5. Release Automation
**Decision**: Automatic releases on every successful build
**Rationale**: User clarified automatic release strategy. Current build.yml already implements automatic releases with version management.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Manual approval - rejected per user clarification
- Conditional releases - rejected as overly complex

### 6. Failure Handling
**Decision**: Fail-fast workflow termination on any job failure
**Rationale**: User clarified that any platform build failure should fail the entire workflow. This ensures quality gates are maintained.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Partial success - rejected per user clarification
- Continue on failure - rejected as compromising quality

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Existing Patterns to Preserve:
- Version generation from .version file + run number
- Platform-specific executable naming
- Artifact caching keys based on file hashes
- Matrix strategy for cross-platform testing

### New Patterns to Implement:
- Lint job with .editorconfig validation (need to check if .editorconfig exists)
- Job dependencies (lint → build → test → release)
- Artifact passing between workflow jobs
- Comprehensive caching strategy

### Potential Risks & Mitigations:
- **Risk**: .editorconfig file missing
  **Mitigation**: Create basic .editorconfig or skip linting if not present
- **Risk**: Artifact size limits
  **Mitigation**: Monitor artifact sizes, implement cleanup if needed
- **Risk**: Cache invalidation issues
  **Mitigation**: Use proper cache keys based on file hashes

## Conclusion

All technical unknowns have been resolved through user clarifications and analysis of existing workflows. The unified workflow approach is technically feasible and aligns with GitHub Actions best practices. The implementation can proceed with confidence that all requirements are well-defined.
